DS Observer
=============
DS Observer is a crawler and parser that gets all data-skins that may be used on a api-key

Why
=============
The access for data-skins has a upper layer to access which data-skins may be used for a certain api-key, making a little difficult and slow to access the info. This project helps to list all the widget data-skins just inserting the api-key

=============
Clone the DS Observer repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:MatheusBNAguiar/data-skin-observer.git
$ cd data-skin-observer
$ npm install
```
